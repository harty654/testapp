			<h4 class="title">Legal Notices</h4>
			<p>We, the Operators of this App, provide it as a public service to our users.</p>
			<p>Please carefully review the following basic rules that govern your use of the App. Please note that your use of the App constitutes your unconditional agreement to follow and be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Use. If you (the “User”) do not agree to them, do not use the App, provide any materials to the App or download any materials from them.</p>
			<p>The Operators reserve the right to update or modify these Terms and Conditions at any time without prior notice to User. Your use of the App following any such change constitutes your unconditional agreement to follow and be bound by these Terms and Conditions as changed. For this reason, we encourage you to review these Terms and Conditions of Use whenever you use the App.</p>
			<p>These Terms and Conditions of Use apply to the use of the App and do not extend to any linked third party sites. These Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy, which are hereby incorporated by reference, contain the entire agreement (the “Agreement”) between you and the Operators with respect to the App. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.</p>
			<h4 class="title">Permitted and Prohibited Uses</h4>

You may not use the the app to violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law, including without limitation any applicable laws relating to antitrust or other illegal trade or business practices, federal and state securities laws, regulations promulgated by the U.K Securities and Exchange Commission, any rules of any national or other securities exchange, and any U.K laws, rules, and regulations governing the export and re-export of commodities or technical data.</p>
			<p>You may not upload or transmit any material that infringes or misappropriates any person&rsquo;s copyright, patent, trademark, or trade secret, or disclose via the the app any information the disclosure of which would constitute a violation of any confidentiality obligations you may have.</p>
			<p>You may not upload any viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other forms of harmful computer code, nor subject the app&rsquo;s network or servers to unreasonable traffic loads, or otherwise engage in conduct deemed disruptive to the ordinary operation of the app.</p>
			<p>You are strictly prohibited from communicating on or through the app any unlawful, harmful, offensive, threatening, abusive, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful, fraudulent, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable material of any sort, including, but not limited to, any material that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law.</p>
			<p>You are expressly prohibited from compiling and using other Users&rsquo; personal information, including addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses or other contact information that may appear on the app, for the purpose of creating or compiling marketing and/or mailing lists and from sending other Users unsolicited marketing materials, whether by facsimile, email, or other technological means.</p>
			<p>You also are expressly prohibited from distributing Users&rsquo; personal information to third-party parties for marketing purposes. The Operators shall deem the compiling of marketing and mailing lists using Users&rsquo; personal information, the sending of unsolicited marketing materials to Users, or the distribution of Users&rsquo; personal information to third parties for marketing purposes as a material breach of these Terms and Conditions of Use, and the Operators reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to and use of the app and to suspend or revoke your membership in the consortium without refund of any membership dues paid.</p>
			<p>The Operators note that unauthorized use of Users&rsquo; personal information in connection with unsolicited marketing correspondence also may constitute violations of various state and federal anti-spam statutes.
